# Gas Classification Model for Volatile Gases
## Overview
This project aims to classify volatile gases based on their concentrations under different environmental conditions. The dataset used in this project contains diverse gas concentrations recorded over time. By developing a gas classification model, we can effectively identify and analyze gas levels, contributing to environmental monitoring and safety measures.

## Key Features
- Utilized Python, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, for data analysis and visualization.
- Implemented various classification models, including SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost Classifier, and Gradient Boost Classifier.
- Conducted thorough testing and evaluation, measuring accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each model.
- Selected the best-performing model and saved it as a pickle file for future use.
